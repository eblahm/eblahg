Once you clone the repository follow these steps

Unfortuntly, I may have other references to my app id in the code... so, If something breaks, I'm sorry.  I'm working on it.

2. Deploy to App Engine

3. Visit /admin/config and fill in your info
ie your Dropbox App Token/Secret, Blog Name, Name etc

4. In the "/Apps/your_dropbox_app_name/" folder in your dropbox create the following directories
/posts
/pics
/pics/sidebar

5. Add content
Add pictures to the /pics/sidebar directory.  These will show up randomly in the sidebar
Add blog posts to the /posts folder

6. manually launch sync script using the url: /admin/sync
